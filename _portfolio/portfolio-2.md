### Overview
Developed a linear programming formulation to simultaneously minimize the number of registers and duplication logic in extended Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (xSFQ) circuits.

### Key Contributions
- Formulated optimization problem for optimal area reduction while maintaining clock period constraints
- Addressed unique challenges in superconducting circuit design
- Achieved significant area improvements in xSFQ logic implementations

### Impact
This work contributes to making superconducting computing more practical by reducing the area overhead of critical circuit components.
