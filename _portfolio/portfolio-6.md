## Multi-threaded SQL Database

**Academic Project**

### Overview
Built a custom database system from scratch with SQL-like query syntax, implementing advanced concurrency control and parallel processing capabilities.

### Key Contributions
- **Database Engine**: Designed and implemented core database functionality with SQL-like syntax support
- **Multi-threading Architecture**: Built robust multi-threaded system for concurrent query processing
- **Thread Pool Implementation**: Developed efficient thread pool management for optimal resource utilization
- **Parallel Reducer**: Implemented parallel reduction algorithms for query acceleration
- **Concurrency Control**: Ensured data consistency and transaction safety in multi-threaded environment

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Systems Programming**: Low-level database implementation in C/C++
- **Concurrency**: Thread management, synchronization, and parallel algorithms
- **Database Design**: Query parsing, execution planning, and storage management
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing and thread pool optimization

### Impact
This project provided deep understanding of database internals, concurrent programming, and system-level performance optimization techniques.
