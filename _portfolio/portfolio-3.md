**Advisor:** Prof. Weikang Qian at SJTU

### Overview
Developed a comprehensive framework for designing and implementing mixed binary-stochastic computing circuits, bridging conventional and stochastic computing paradigms.

### Key Contributions
- Defined a domain-specific language (DSL) for agile mixed circuit development
- Implemented a Verilog code generation backend for the DSL to facilitate hardware synthesis
- Evaluated mixed binary-stochastic circuits for image processing applications

### Publications
This work resulted in the SCGen framework, published at DATE 2024, providing a versatile generator framework for stochastic circuit development.

### Impact
Enabled rapid prototyping and evaluation of novel computing paradigms that combine the benefits of both binary and stochastic computing approaches.
