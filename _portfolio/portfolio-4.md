### Overview
Developed a machine learning framework using Graph Neural Networks to provide accurate and fast prediction of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) metrics, improving the design space exploration process.

### Key Contributions
- Implemented Graph Neural Network models for HLS metric prediction
- Built a feature extraction system from HLS reports and intermediate files
- Designed pipeline for processing complex hardware design graphs
- Explored Neural Architecture Search for model optimization and transfer learning for large graphs

### Technical Impact
This work addressed the critical challenge of predicting hardware synthesis outcomes early in the design process, potentially reducing design iteration time and improving hardware optimization workflows.
