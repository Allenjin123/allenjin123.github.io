## Mozart: An Ecosystem-Accelerator Codesign Framework

**Duration:** Jan. 2025 – Aug. 2025
**Advisor:** Prof. Nathaniel Bleier at University of Michigan

### Overview
Developed a chiplet ecosystem-accelerator codesign framework to increase chiplet reuse and reduce non-recurring engineering costs for neural network accelerators.

### Key Contributions
- Built hierarchical design space exploration methodology to systematically compose heterogeneous chiplet-based bespoke ASICs
- Leveraged operator-level disaggregation insights for optimal chiplet composition
- Implemented constraint-aware optimization for datacenter LLM serving and autonomous vehicle case studies

### Status
Currently under submission to ASPLOS 2025.
