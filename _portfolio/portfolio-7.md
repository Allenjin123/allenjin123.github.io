## Scheduling Algorithm in Minix 3.2.1

**Academic Project**

### Overview
Implemented advanced process scheduling algorithms directly in the Minix 3.2.1 operating system kernel, exploring real-time and probabilistic scheduling paradigms.

### Key Contributions
- **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**: Implemented optimal real-time scheduling algorithm for deadline-sensitive tasks
- **Lottery Scheduling**: Developed probabilistic scheduling mechanism providing proportional share resource allocation
- **Kernel Integration**: Modified kernel space code to integrate custom scheduling policies
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluated scheduling algorithm performance under different workload conditions

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Operating Systems**: Deep kernel-level programming and system call implementation
- **Real-time Systems**: Understanding of deadline constraints and timing guarantees
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Translation of theoretical scheduling algorithms to practical implementations
- **System Programming**: Low-level C programming in kernel space with strict resource constraints

### Learning Outcomes
This project provided comprehensive understanding of operating system internals, process management, and the critical role of scheduling in system performance and real-time guarantees.
