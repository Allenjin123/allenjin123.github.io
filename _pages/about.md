I am currently a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, specializing in Computer Architecture and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). I am advised by Prof. Nathaniel Bleier, with previous mentorship from Prof. George Tzimpragos. You may check my [CV](https://allenjin123.github.io/files/HaoranJin_CV.pdf) for details.

My research interests focus on computer architecture and electronic design automation, with particular emphasis on chiplet-based neural network accelerators, novel computing paradigms, and hardware optimization. I am currently working on ecosystem-accelerator codesign frameworks for composable, heterogeneous chiplet-based systems.

I completed my B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in August 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to collaborate with distinguished researchers including [Prof. Weikang Qian(SJTU)](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~wkqian/people/weikang-qian.html) on stochastic computing and mixed circuits.
