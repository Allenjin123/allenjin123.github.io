I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, specializing in Computer Architecture and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). I am advised by [Prof. Nathaniel Bleier](https://crucible.eecs.umich.edu/person.html?id=nathan-bleier), with previous mentorship from [Prof. George Tzimpragos](https://www.georgetzimpragos.com/). I'm a proud member of [CCG research lab](https://crucible.eecs.umich.edu/index.html). You may check my [CV](https://allenjin123.github.io/files/HaoranJin_CV.pdf) for details.

My research interests focus on computer architecture and electronic design automation, with particular emphasis on hardware-software codesign for machine learning applications. I am currently working on composing chiplet-based neural network accelerators.

I completed my B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in August 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to collaborate with distinguished researchers, [Prof. Weikang Qian(SJTU)](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~wkqian/people/weikang-qian.html) on stochastic computing and mixed circuits and [Prof. Jieru Zhao(SJTU)](https://zjru.github.io/) on machine learning for HLS.
