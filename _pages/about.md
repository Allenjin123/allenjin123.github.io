I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University([SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)). My GPA is 3.81 with a ranking of 14/255. You may checked my [CV](https://allenjin123.github.io/files/HaoranJin_CV.pdf) for details.

My research interest mainly lies in electronic design automation and computer architectures. More specially, I'm interested in new computing paradigm such as stochastic computing, agile EDA, High-Level-Synthesis and non-volatile memory.

I am really fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Huang Jian(UIUC)](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/), [Prof. Weikang Qian(SJTU)](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~wkqian/people/weikang-qian.html) and [Prof. Jieru Zhao(SJTU)](https://zjru.github.io/)(in chronological order). Thanks a lot for the time and efforts of these distinguished scholars.

I am applying for PhD programs, and I expect to graduate in Summer 2023. Please reach out to me if your are looking for PhD students.
